(1)  ³ Following is a simplified summary of how the Note Monthly Principal Distributable Amount is calculated: The Note
Monthly Principal Distributable Amount shown above with respect to any Payment Date will equal the amount necessary to be
paid on the Notes to reduce the Outstanding Amount of the Notes — after giving effect to the application of the First Principal
P ayment Amount (set forth in the line above the ³ Note Monthly Principal Distributable Amount”) to reduce such Outstanding
"Amount — to an amount equal to the Pool Balance as of the beginning of the current Collection Period, less the Cumulative"
Turbo Principal Payment Amount (overcollateralization) as of the previous Payment Date; provided that (a) the Note Monthly
P rincipal Distributable Amount shall not exceed the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Notes (after giving effect to the
application of the First Principal Payment Amount to reduce such Outstanding Amount) and (b) on the final maturity date for
"each Class of Notes, the Note Monthly Principal Distributable Amount will at least equal the amount necessary to repay the"
Outstanding Amount of that Class of Notes and of any other Class of Notes payable prior to that Class of Notes (after giving
effect to the application of the First Principal Payment Amount to reduce such Outstanding Amount). For purposes of the
"preceding sentence, the A-1 Notes, A-2 Notes, A-3 Notes and the A-4 Notes shall each be deemed to be a separate Class of"
Notes.  Please see the transaction documents previously filed with respect to this issuing entity under Form 8-K for details
regarding all of the preceding calculations and for the definitions of defined terms.”
